# Chicago Real Estate Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts **real estate prices in Chicago** using machine learning models. It involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training** using the following models:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

The dataset includes key property attributes such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and past sale prices.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tushar12023/Chicago-Real-Estate-Prediction.git
cd Chicago-Real-Estate-Prediction
```

### Run Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Open **`chicago-real-estate-prediction.ipynb`** and execute the cells to preprocess the data and train the models.

## Results

### Model Performance (R² Score)
- **Linear Regression:** 0.72
- **Random Forest Regressor:** 0.79 (Best Performing)
- **XGBoost Regressor:** 0.54

The **Random Forest Regressor** provided the best accuracy for predicting real estate prices.
